/**
 * An injectable service that produces an animation sequence programmatically within an
 * Angular component or directive.
 * Provided by the `BrowserAnimationsModule` or `NoopAnimationsModule`.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * To use this service, add it to your component or directive as a dependency.
 * The service is instantiated along with your component.
 *
 * Apps do not typically need to create their own animation players, but if you
 * do need to, follow these steps:
 *
 * 1. Use the `build()` method to create a programmatic animation using the
 * `animate()` function. The method returns an `AnimationFactory` instance.
 *
 * 2. Use the factory object to create an `AnimationPlayer` and attach it to a DOM element.
 *
 * 3. Use the player object to control the animation programmatically.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * ```ts
 * // import the service from BrowserAnimationsModule
 * import {AnimationBuilder} from '@angular/animations';
 * // require the service as a dependency
 * class MyCmp {
 *   constructor(private _builder: AnimationBuilder) {}
 *
 *   makeAnimation(element: any) {
 *     // first define a reusable animation
 *     const myAnimation = this._builder.build([
 *       style({ width: 0 }),
 *       animate(1000, style({ width: '100px' }))
 *     ]);
 *
 *     // use the returned factory object to create a player
 *     const player = myAnimation.create(element);
 *
 *     player.play();
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 */
var AnimationBuilder = /** @class */ (function () {
    function AnimationBuilder() {
    }
    return AnimationBuilder;
}());
/**
 * A factory object returned from the `AnimationBuilder`.`build()` method.
 *

    function AnimationFactory() {
    }
    return AnimationFactory;

var AUTO_STYLE = '*';
/**
 * Creates a named animation trigger, containing a  list of `state()`
 * and `transition()` entries to be evaluated when the expression
 * bound to the trigger changes.
 *
 * @param name An identifying string.
 * @param definitions  An animation definition object, containing an array of `state()`
 * and `transition()` declarations.
 *
 * @return An object that encapsulates the trigger data.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * Define an animation trigger in the `animations` section of `@Component` metadata.
 * In the template, reference the trigger by name and bind it to a trigger expression that
 * evaluates to a defined animation state, using the following format:
 *
 * `[@triggerName]="expression"`
 *
 * Animation trigger bindings convert all values to strings, and then match the
 * previous and current values against any linked transitions.
 * Booleans can be specified as `1` or `true` and `0` or `false`.
 *
 * ### Usage Example
 *
 * The following example creates an animation trigger reference based on the provided
 * name value.
 * The provided animation value is expected to be an array consisting of state and
 * transition declarations.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * @Component({
 *   selector: "my-component",
 *   templateUrl: "my-component-tpl.html",
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger("myAnimationTrigger", [
 *       state(...),
 *       state(...),
 *       transition(...),
 *       transition(...)
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class MyComponent {
 *   myStatusExp = "something";
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The template associated with this component makes use of the defined trigger
 * by binding to an element within its template code.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->
 * <div [@myAnimationTrigger]="myStatusExp">...</div>
 * ```
 *
 * ### Using an inline function
 * The `transition` animation method also supports reading an inline function which can decide
 * if its associated animation should be run.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // this method is run each time the `myAnimationTrigger` trigger value changes.
 * function myInlineMatcherFn(fromState: string, toState: string, element: any, params: {[key:
 string]: any}): boolean {
 *   // notice that `element` and `params` are also available here
 *   return toState == 'yes-please-animate';
 * }
 *
 * @Component({
 *   selector: 'my-component',
 *   templateUrl: 'my-component-tpl.html',
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger('myAnimationTrigger', [
 *       transition(myInlineMatcherFn, [
 *         // the animation sequence code
 *       ]),
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class MyComponent {
 *   myStatusExp = "yes-please-animate";
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Disabling Animations
 * When true, the special animation control binding `@.disabled` binding prevents
 * all animations from rendering.
 * Place the  `@.disabled` binding on an element to disable
 * animations on the element itself, as well as any inner animation triggers
 * within the element.
 *
 * The following example shows how to use this feature:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * @Component({
 *   selector: 'my-component',
 *   template: `
 *     <div [@.disabled]="isDisabled">
 *       <div [@childAnimation]="exp"></div>
 *     </div>
 *   `,
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger("childAnimation", [
 *       // ...
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class MyComponent {
 *   isDisabled = true;
 *   exp = '...';
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * When `@.disabled` is true, it prevents the `@childAnimation` trigger from animating,
 * along with any inner animations.
 *
 * ### Disable animations application-wide
 * When an area of the template is set to have animations disabled,
 * **all** inner components have their animations disabled as well.
 * This means that you can disable all animations for an app
 * by placing a host binding set on `@.disabled` on the topmost Angular component.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import {Component, HostBinding} from '@angular/core';
 *
 * @Component({
 *   selector: 'app-component',
 *   templateUrl: 'app.component.html',
 * })
 * class AppComponent {
 *   @HostBinding('@.disabled')
 *   public animationsDisabled = true;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Overriding disablement of inner animations
 * Despite inner animations being disabled, a parent animation can `query()`
 * for inner elements located in disabled areas of the template and still animate
 * them if needed. This is also the case for when a sub animation is
 * queried by a parent and then later animated using `animateChild()`.
 *
 * ### Detecting when an animation is disabled
 * If a region of the DOM (or the entire application) has its animations disabled, the animation
 * trigger callbacks still fire, but for zero seconds. When the callback fires, it provides
 * an instance of an `AnimationEvent`. If animations are disabled,
 * the `.disabled` flag on the event is true.
 *
 * @experimental Animation support is experimental.

/**
 * Defines an animation step that combines styling information with timing information.
 *
 * @param timings Sets `AnimateTimings` for the parent animation.
 * A string in the format "duration [delay] [easing]".
 *  - Duration and delay are expressed as a number and optional time unit,
 * such as "1s" or "10ms" for one second and 10 milliseconds, respectively.
 * The default unit is milliseconds.
 *  - The easing value controls how the animation accelerates and decelerates
 * during its runtime. Value is one of  `ease`, `ease-in`, `ease-out`,
 * `ease-in-out`, or a `cubic-bezier()` function call.
 * If not supplied, no easing is applied.
 *
 * For example, the string "1s 100ms ease-out" specifies a duration of
 * 1000 milliseconds, and delay of 100 ms, and the "ease-out" easing style,
 * which decelerates near the end of the duration.
 * @param styles Sets AnimationStyles for the parent animation.
 * A function call to either `style()` or `keyframes()`
 * that returns a collection of CSS style entries to be applied to the parent animation.
 * When null, uses the styles from the destination state.
 * This is useful when describing an animation step that will complete an animation;
 * see "Animating to the final state" in `transitions()`.
 * @returns An object that encapsulates the animation step.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * Call within an animation `sequence()`, `{@link animations/group group()}`, or
 * `transition()` call to specify an animation step
 * that applies given style data to the parent animation for a given amount of time.
 *
 * ### Syntax Examples
 * **Timing examples**
 *
 * The following examples show various `timings` specifications.
 * - `animate(500)` : Duration is 500 milliseconds.
 * - `animate("1s")` : Duration is 1000 milliseconds.
 * - `animate("100ms 0.5s")` : Duration is 100 milliseconds, delay is 500 milliseconds.
 * - `animate("5s ease-in")` : Duration is 5000 milliseconds, easing in.
 * - `animate("5s 10ms cubic-bezier(.17,.67,.88,.1)")` : Duration is 5000 milliseconds, delay is 10
 * milliseconds, easing according to a bezier curve.
 *
 * **Style examples**
 *
 * The following example calls `style()` to set a single CSS style.
 * ```typescript
 * animate(500, style({ background: "red" }))
 * ```
 * The following example calls `keyframes()` to set a CSS style
 * to different values for successive keyframes.
 * ```typescript
 * animate(500, keyframes(
 *  [
 *   style({ background: "blue" })),
 *   style({ background: "red" }))
 *  ])
 * ```

 * @returns An object that encapsulates the keyframes data.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * Use with the `animate()` call. Instead of applying animations
 * from the current state
 * to the destination state, keyframes describe how each style entry is applied and at what point
 * within the animation arc.
 * Compare [CSS Keyframe Animations](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp).
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * In the following example, the offset values describe
 * when each `backgroundColor` value is applied. The color is red at the start, and changes to
 * blue when 20% of the total time has elapsed.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // the provided offset values

 *   style({ backgroundColor: "black", offset: 1 })
 * ]))
 * ```
 *
 * If there are no `offset` values specified in the style entries, the offsets
 * are calculated automatically.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * animate("5s", keyframes([
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "red" }) // offset = 0
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "blue" }) // offset = 0.33
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "orange" }) // offset = 0.66
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "black" }) // offset = 1
 * ]))
 *```

/**
 * Declares an animation transition as a sequence of animation steps to run when a given
 * condition is satisfied. The condition is a Boolean expression or function that compares
 * the previous and current animation states, and returns true if this transition should occur.
 * When the state criteria of a defined transition are met, the associated animation is
 * triggered.
 *
 * @param stateChangeExpr A Boolean expression or function that compares the previous and current
 * animation states, and returns true if this transition should occur. Note that  "true" and "false"
 * match 1 and 0, respectively. An expression is evaluated each time a state change occurs in the
 * animation trigger element.
 * The animation steps run when the expression evaluates to true.
 *
 * - A state-change string takes the form "state1 => state2", where each side is a defined animation
 * state, or an asterix (*) to refer to a dynamic start or end state.
 *   - The expression string can contain multiple comma-separated statements;
 * for example "state1 => state2, state3 => state4".
 *   - Special values `:enter` and `:leave` initiate a transition on the entry and exit states,
 * equivalent to  "void => *"  and "* => void".
 *   - Special values `:increment` and `:decrement` initiate a transition when a numeric value has
 * increased or decreased in value.
 * - A function is executed each time a state change occurs in the animation trigger element.
 * The animation steps run when the function returns true.
 *
 * @param steps One or more animation objects, as returned by the `animate()` or
 * `sequence()` function, that form a transformation from one state to another.
 * A sequence is used by default when you pass an array.
 * @param options An options object that can contain a delay value for the start of the animation,
 * and additional developer-defined parameters. Provided values for additional parameters are used
 * as defaults, and override values can be passed to the caller on invocation.
 * @returns An object that encapsulates the transition data.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * The template associated with a component binds an animation trigger to an element.
 *
 * ```HTML
 * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->
 * <div [@myAnimationTrigger]="myStatusExp">...</div>
 * ```
 *
 * All transitions are defined within an animation trigger,
 * along with named states that the transitions change to and from.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * trigger("myAnimationTrigger", [
 *  // define states
 *  state("on", style({ background: "green" })),
 *  state("off", style({ background: "grey" })),
 *  ...]
 * ```
 *
 * Note that when you call the `sequence()` function within a `{@link animations/group group()}`
 * or a `transition()` call, execution does not continue to the next instruction
 * until each of the inner animation steps have completed.
 *
 * ### Syntax examples
 *
 * The following examples define transitions between the two defined states (and default states),
 * using various options:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // Transition occurs when the state value
 * // bound to "myAnimationTrigger" changes from "on" to "off"
 * transition("on => off", animate(500))
 * // Run the same animation for both directions
 * transition("on <=> off", animate(500))
 * // Define multiple state-change pairs separated by commas
 * transition("on => off, off => void", animate(500))
 * ```
 *
 * ### Special values for state-change expressions
 *
 * - Catch-all state change for when an element is inserted into the page and the
 * destination state is unknown:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * transition("void => *", [
 *  style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *  animate(500)
 *  ])
 * ```
 *
 * - Capture a state change between any states:
 *
 *  `transition("* => *", animate("1s 0s"))`
 *
 * - Entry and exit transitions:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * transition(":enter", [
 *   style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))
 *   ]),
 * transition(":leave", [
 *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 0 }))
 *   ])
 * ```
 *
 * - Use `:increment` and `:decrement` to initiate transitions:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * transition(":increment", group([
 *  query(':enter', [
 *     style({ left: '100%' }),
 *     animate('0.5s ease-out', style('*'))
 *   ]),
 *  query(':leave', [
 *     animate('0.5s ease-out', style({ left: '-100%' }))
 *  ])
 * ]))
 *
 * transition(":decrement", group([
 *  query(':enter', [
 *     style({ left: '100%' }),
 *     animate('0.5s ease-out', style('*'))
 *   ]),
 *  query(':leave', [
 *     animate('0.5s ease-out', style({ left: '-100%' }))
 *  ])
 * ]))
 * ```
 *
 * ### State-change functions
 *
 * Here is an example of a `fromState` specified as a state-change function that invokes an
 * animation when true:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * transition((fromState, toState) =>
 *  {
 *   return fromState == "off" && toState == "on";
 *  },
 *  animate("1s 0s"))
 * ```
 *
 * ### Animating to the final state
 *
 * If the final step in a transition is a call to `animate()` that uses a timing value
 * with no style data, that step is automatically considered the final animation arc,
 * for the element to reach the final state. Angular automatically adds or removes
 * CSS styles to ensure that the element is in the correct final state.
 *
 * The following example defines a transition that starts by hiding the element,
 * then makes sure that it animates properly to whatever state is currently active for trigger:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * transition("void => *", [
 *   style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *   animate(500)
 *  ])
 * ```
 * ### Boolean value matching
 * If a trigger binding value is a Boolean, it can be matched using a transition expression
 * that compares true and false or 1 and 0. For example:
 *
 * ```
 * // in the template
 * <div [@openClose]="open ? true : false">...</div>
 * // in the component metadata
 * trigger('openClose', [
 *   state('true', style({ height: '*' })),
 *   state('false', style({ height: '0px' })),
 *   transition('false <=> true', animate(500))
 * ])
 * ```

 *
 * @usageNotes
 * Each time an animation is triggered in Angular, the parent animation
 * has priority and any child animations are blocked. In order
 * for a child animation to run, the parent animation must query each of the elements
 * containing child animations, and run them using this function.
 *
 * Note that this feature designed to be used with `query()` and it will only work
 * with animations that are assigned using the Angular animation library. CSS keyframes
 * and transitions are not handled by this API.

/**
 * Finds one or more inner elements within the current element that is
 * being animated within a sequence. Use with `animateChild()`.
 *
 * @param selector The element to query, or a set of elements that contain Angular-specific
 * characteristics, specified with one or more of the following tokens.
 *  - `query(":enter")` or `query(":leave")` : Query for newly inserted/removed elements.
 *  - `query(":animating")` : Query all currently animating elements.
 *  - `query("@triggerName")` : Query elements that contain an animation trigger.
 *  - `query("@*")` : Query all elements that contain an animation triggers.
 *  - `query(":self")` : Include the current element into the animation sequence.
 *
 * @param animation One or more animation steps to apply to the queried element or elements.
 * An array is treated as an animation sequence.
 * @param options An options object. Use the 'limit' field to limit the total number of
 * items to collect.
 * @return An object that encapsulates the query data.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * Tokens can be merged into a combined query selector string. For example:
 *
 * ```typescript
 *  query(':self, .record:enter, .record:leave, @subTrigger', [...])
 * ```
 *
 * The `query()` function collects multiple elements and works internally by using
 * `element.querySelectorAll`. Use the `limit` field of an options object to limit
 * the total number of items to be collected. For example:
 *
 * ```js
 * query('div', [
 *   animate(...),
 *   animate(...)
 * ], { limit: 1 })
 * ```
 *
 * By default, throws an error when zero items are found. Set the
 * `optional` flag to ignore this error. For example:
 *
 * ```js
 * query('.some-element-that-may-not-be-there', [
 *   animate(...),
 *   animate(...)
 * ], { optional: true })
 * ```
 *
 * ### Usage Example
 *
 * The following example queries for inner elements and animates them
 * individually using `animateChild()`.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * @Component({
 *   selector: 'inner',
 *   template: `
 *     <div [@queryAnimation]="exp">
 *       <h1>Title</h1>
 *       <div class="content">
 *         Blah blah blah
 *       </div>
 *     </div>
 *   `,
 *   animations: [
 *    trigger('queryAnimation', [
 *      transition('* => goAnimate', [
 *        // hide the inner elements
 *        query('h1', style({ opacity: 0 })),
 *        query('.content', style({ opacity: 0 })),
 *
 *        // animate the inner elements in, one by one
 *        query('h1', animate(1000, style({ opacity: 1 })),
 *        query('.content', animate(1000, style({ opacity: 1 })),
 *      ])
 *    ])
 *  ]
 * })
 * class Cmp {
 *   exp = '';
 *
 *   goAnimate() {
 *     this.exp = 'goAnimate';
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 */
function query(selector, animation, options) {
    if (options === void 0) { options = null; }
    return { type: 11 /* Query */, selector: selector, animation: animation, options: options };
}
/**
 * Use within an animation `query()` call to issue a timing gap after
 * each queried item is animated.
 *
 * @param timings A delay value.
 * @param animation One ore more animation steps.
 * @returns An object that encapsulates the stagger data.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * In the following example, a container element wraps a list of items stamped out
 * by an `ngFor`. The container element contains an animation trigger that will later be set
 * to query for each of the inner items.
 *
 * Each time items are added, the opacity fade-in animation runs,
 * and each removed item is faded out.
 * When either of these animations occur, the stagger effect is
 * applied after each item's animation is started.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- list.component.html -->
 * <button (click)="toggle()">Show / Hide Items</button>
 * <hr />
 * <div [@listAnimation]="items.length">
 *   <div *ngFor="let item of items">
 *     {{ item }}
 *   </div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * Here is the component code:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import {trigger, transition, style, animate, query, stagger} from '@angular/animations';
 * @Component({
 *   templateUrl: 'list.component.html',
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger('listAnimation', [
 *     ...
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class ListComponent {
 *   items = [];
 *
 *   showItems() {
 *     this.items = [0,1,2,3,4];
 *   }
 *
 *   hideItems() {
 *     this.items = [];
 *   }
 *
 *   toggle() {
 *     this.items.length ? this.hideItems() : this.showItems();
 *    }
 *  }
 * ```
 *
 * Here is the animation trigger code:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * trigger('listAnimation', [
 *   transition('* => *', [ // each time the binding value changes
 *     query(':leave', [
 *       stagger(100, [
 *         animate('0.5s', style({ opacity: 0 }))
 *       ])
 *     ]),
 *     query(':enter', [
 *       style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *       stagger(100, [
 *         animate('0.5s', style({ opacity: 1 }))
 *       ])
 *     ])
 *   ])
 * ])
 * ```

/*
 * [Validation]
 * The visitor code below will traverse the animation AST generated by the animation verb functions
 * (the output is a tree of objects) and attempt to perform a series of validations on the data. The
 * following corner-cases will be validated:
 *
 * 1. Overlap of animations
 * Given that a CSS property cannot be animated in more than one place at the same time, it's
 * important that this behaviour is detected and validated. The way in which this occurs is that
 * each time a style property is examined, a string-map containing the property will be updated with
 * the start and end times for when the property is used within an animation step.
 *
 * If there are two or more parallel animations that are currently running (these are invoked by the
 * group()) on the same element then the validator will throw an error. Since the start/end timing
 * values are collected for each property then if the current animation step is animating the same
 * property and its timing values fall anywhere into the window of time that the property is
 * currently being animated within then this is what causes an error.
 *
 * 2. Timing values
 * The validator will validate to see if a timing value of `duration delay easing` or
 * `durationNumber` is valid or not.
 *
 * (note that upon validation the code below will replace the timing data with an object containing
 * {duration,delay,easing}.
 *
 * 3. Offset Validation
 * Each of the style() calls are allowed to have an offset value when placed inside of keyframes().
 * Offsets within keyframes() are considered valid when:
 *
 *   - No offsets are used at all
 *   - Each style() entry contains an offset value
 *   - Each offset is between 0 and 1
 *   - Each offset is greater to or equal than the previous one
 *
 * Otherwise an error will be thrown.

/*
 * The code within this file aims to generate web-animations-compatible keyframes from Angular's
 * animation DSL code.
 *
 * The code below will be converted from:
 *
 * ```
 * sequence([
 *   style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *   animate(1000, style({ opacity: 0 }))
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * To:
 * ```
 * keyframes = [{ opacity: 0, offset: 0 }, { opacity: 1, offset: 1 }]
 * duration = 1000
 * delay = 0
 * easing = ''
 * ```
 *
 * For this operation to cover the combination of animation verbs (style, animate, group, etc...) a
 * combination of prototypical inheritance, AST traversal and merge-sort-like algorithms are used.
 *
 * [AST Traversal]
 * Each of the animation verbs, when executed, will return an string-map object representing what
 * type of action it is (style, animate, group, etc...) and the data associated with it. This means
 * that when functional composition mix of these functions is evaluated (like in the example above)
 * then it will end up producing a tree of objects representing the animation itself.
 *
 * When this animation object tree is processed by the visitor code below it will visit each of the
 * verb statements within the visitor. And during each visit it will build the context of the
 * animation keyframes by interacting with the `TimelineBuilder`.
 *
 * [TimelineBuilder]
 * This class is responsible for tracking the styles and building a series of keyframe objects for a
 * timeline between a start and end time. The builder starts off with an initial timeline and each
 * time the AST comes across a `group()`, `keyframes()` or a combination of the two wihtin a
 * `sequence()` then it will generate a sub timeline for each step as well as a new one after
 * they are complete.
 *
 * As the AST is traversed, the timing state on each of the timelines will be incremented. If a sub
 * timeline was created (based on one of the cases above) then the parent timeline will attempt to
 * merge the styles used within the sub timelines into itself (only with group() this will happen).
 * This happens with a merge operation (much like how the merge works in mergesort) and it will only
 * copy the most recently used styles from the sub timelines into the parent timeline. This ensures
 * that if the styles are used later on in another phase of the animation then they will be the most
 * up-to-date values.
 *
 * [How Missing Styles Are Updated]
 * Each timeline has a `backFill` property which is responsible for filling in new styles into
 * already processed keyframes if a new style shows up later within the animation sequence.
 *
 * ```
 * sequence([
 *   style({ width: 0 }),
 *   animate(1000, style({ width: 100 })),
 *   animate(1000, style({ width: 200 })),
 *   animate(1000, style({ width: 300 }))
 *   animate(1000, style({ width: 400, height: 400 })) // notice how `height` doesn't exist anywhere
 * else
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * What is happening here is that the `height` value is added later in the sequence, but is missing
 * from all previous animation steps. Therefore when a keyframe is created it would also be missing
 * from all previous keyframes up until where it is first used. For the timeline keyframe generation
 * to properly fill in the style it will place the previous value (the value from the parent
 * timeline) or a default value of `*` into the backFill object. Given that each of the keyframe
 * styles are objects that prototypically inhert from the backFill object, this means that if a
 * value is added into the backFill then it will automatically propagate any missing values to all
 * keyframes. Therefore the missing `height` value will be properly filled into the already
 * processed keyframes.
 *
 * When a sub-timeline is created it will have its own backFill property. This is done so that
 * styles present within the sub-timeline do not accidentally seep into the previous/future timeline
 * keyframes
 *
 * (For prototypically-inherited contents to be detected a `for(i in obj)` loop must be used.)
 *
 * [Validation]
 * The code in this file is not responsible for validation. That functionality happens with within
 * the `AnimationValidatorVisitor` code.

 * implementation specific to the browser environment, while `@angular/platform-webworker` provides
 * one suitable for use with web workers.
 *

 * @description
 * A {@link LocationStrategy} used to configure the {@link Location} service to
 * represent its state in the
 * [path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator#Syntax) of the
 * browser's URL.
 *
 * If you're using `PathLocationStrategy`, you must provide a {@link APP_BASE_HREF}
 * or add a base element to the document. This URL prefix that will be preserved
 * when generating and recognizing URLs.
 *
 * For instance, if you provide an `APP_BASE_HREF` of `'/my/app'` and call
 * `location.go('/foo')`, the browser's URL will become
 * `example.com/my/app/foo`.
 *
 * Similarly, if you add `<base href='/my/app'/>` to the document and call
 * `location.go('/foo')`, the browser's URL will become
 * `example.com/my/app/foo`.

 * What you want to pay attention to are:
 * - possibly removing a space for languages that don't use it, such as many East Asian languages
 * - possibly adding a comma, other punctuation, or a combining word
 *
 * For example:
 * - English uses `{1} 'at' {0}` or `{1}, {0}` (depending on date style), while Japanese uses
 *  `{1}{0}`.
 * - An English formatted date-time using the combining pattern `{1}, {0}` could be
 *  `Dec 10, 2010, 3:59:49 PM`. Notice the comma and space between the date portion and the time
 *  portion.
 *
 * There are four formats (`full`, `long`, `medium`, `short`); the determination of which to use
 * is normally based on the date style. For example, if the date has a full month and weekday
 * name, the full combining pattern will be used to combine that with a time. If the date has
 * numeric month, the short version of the combining pattern will be used to combine that with a
 * time. English uses `{1} 'at' {0}` for full and long styles, and `{1}, {0}` for medium and short

 *
 * Here are the special characters used in number patterns:
 *
 * | Symbol | Meaning |
 * |--------|---------|
 * | . | Replaced automatically by the character used for the decimal point. |
 * | , | Replaced by the "grouping" (thousands) separator. |

 * | # | Replaced by a digit (or nothing if there aren't enough). |
 * | ¤ | This will be replaced by a currency symbol, such as $ or USD. |
 * | % | This marks a percent format. The % symbol may change position, but must be retained. |

 * - `string` - the CSS classes listed in the string (space delimited) are added,
 * - `Array` - the CSS classes declared as Array elements are added,
 * - `Object` - keys are CSS classes that get added when the expression given in the value
 *              evaluates to a truthy value, otherwise they are removed.

 * Instantiates a single {@link Component} type and inserts its Host View into current View.
 * `NgComponentOutlet` provides a declarative approach for dynamic component creation.
 *
 * `NgComponentOutlet` requires a component type, if a falsy value is set the view will clear and
 * any existing component will get destroyed.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Fine tune control
 *
 * You can control the component creation process by using the following optional attributes:
 *
 * * `ngComponentOutletInjector`: Optional custom {@link Injector} that will be used as parent for
 * the Component. Defaults to the injector of the current view container.
 *
 * * `ngComponentOutletContent`: Optional list of projectable nodes to insert into the content
 * section of the component, if exists.
 *
 * * `ngComponentOutletNgModuleFactory`: Optional module factory to allow dynamically loading other
 * module, then load a component from that module.
 *
 * ### Syntax
 *
 * Simple
 * ```
 * <ng-container *ngComponentOutlet="componentTypeExpression"></ng-container>
 * ```
 *
 * Customized injector/content
 * ```
 * <ng-container *ngComponentOutlet="componentTypeExpression;
 *                                   injector: injectorExpression;
 *                                   content: contentNodesExpression;">
 * </ng-container>
 * ```
 *
 * Customized ngModuleFactory
 * ```
 * <ng-container *ngComponentOutlet="componentTypeExpression;
 *                                   ngModuleFactory: moduleFactory;">
 * </ng-container>
 * ```
 *
 * ### A simple example
 *
 * {@example common/ngComponentOutlet/ts/module.ts region='SimpleExample'}
 *
 * A more complete example with additional options:
 *

 * The `NgForOf` directive instantiates a template once per item from an iterable. The context
 * for each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable
 * set to the current item from the iterable.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Local Variables
 *
 * `NgForOf` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:
 *
 * - `$implicit: T`: The value of the individual items in the iterable (`ngForOf`).
 * - `ngForOf: NgIterable<T>`: The value of the iterable expression. Useful when the expression is
 * more complex then a property access, for example when using the async pipe (`userStreams |
 * async`).
 * - `index: number`: The index of the current item in the iterable.
 * - `first: boolean`: True when the item is the first item in the iterable.
 * - `last: boolean`: True when the item is the last item in the iterable.
 * - `even: boolean`: True when the item has an even index in the iterable.
 * - `odd: boolean`: True when the item has an odd index in the iterable.
 *
 * ```
 * <li *ngFor="let user of userObservable | async as users; index as i; first as isFirst">
 *    {{i}}/{{users.length}}. {{user}} <span *ngIf="isFirst">default</span>
 * </li>
 * ```
 *
 * ### Change Propagation
 *
 * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgForOf` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:
 *
 * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.
 * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.
 * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.
 * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.
 *
 * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce
 * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful
 * controls (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can
 * be animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state
 * such as user input.
 *
 * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.
 * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that
 * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with
 * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old
 * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should
 * be avoided if possible.
 *
 * To customize the default tracking algorithm, `NgForOf` supports `trackBy` option.
 * `trackBy` takes a function which has two arguments: `index` and `item`.
 * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.
 *
 * ### Syntax
 *
 * - `<li *ngFor="let item of items; index as i; trackBy: trackByFn">...</li>`
 *
 * With `<ng-template>` element:
 *
 * ```
 * <ng-template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]="items" let-i="index" [ngForTrackBy]="trackByFn">
 *   <li>...</li>
 * </ng-template>
 * ```
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * See a [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/KVuXxDp0qinGDyo307QW?p=preview) for a more detailed
 * example.

/**
 * Conditionally includes a template based on the value of an `expression`.
 *
 * `ngIf` evaluates the `expression` and then renders the `then` or `else` template in its place
 * when expression is truthy or falsy respectively. Typically the:
 *  - `then` template is the inline template of `ngIf` unless bound to a different value.
 *  - `else` template is blank unless it is bound.
 *
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Most common usage
 *
 * The most common usage of the `ngIf` directive is to conditionally show the inline template as
 * seen in this example:
 * {@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfSimple'}
 *
 * ### Showing an alternative template using `else`
 *
 * If it is necessary to display a template when the `expression` is falsy use the `else` template
 * binding as shown. Note that the `else` binding points to a `<ng-template>` labeled `#elseBlock`.
 * The template can be defined anywhere in the component view but is typically placed right after
 * `ngIf` for readability.
 *
 * {@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfElse'}
 *
 * ### Using non-inlined `then` template
 *
 * Usually the `then` template is the inlined template of the `ngIf`, but it can be changed using
 * a binding (just like `else`). Because `then` and `else` are bindings, the template references can
 * change at runtime as shown in this example.
 *
 * {@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfThenElse'}
 *
 * ### Storing conditional result in a variable
 *
 * A common pattern is that we need to show a set of properties from the same object. If the
 * object is undefined, then we have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to guard against
 * dereferencing a `null` value. This is especially the case when waiting on async data such as
 * when using the `async` pipe as shown in following example:
 *
 * ```
 * Hello {{ (userStream|async)?.last }}, {{ (userStream|async)?.first }}!
 * ```
 *
 * There are several inefficiencies in the above example:
 *  - We create multiple subscriptions on `userStream`. One for each `async` pipe, or two in the
 *    example above.
 *  - We cannot display an alternative screen while waiting for the data to arrive asynchronously.
 *  - We have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties, which is cumbersome.
 *  - We have to place the `async` pipe in parenthesis.
 *
 * A better way to do this is to use `ngIf` and store the result of the condition in a local
 * variable as shown in the the example below:
 *
 * {@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfAs'}
 *
 * Notice that:
 *  - We use only one `async` pipe and hence only one subscription gets created.
 *  - `ngIf` stores the result of the `userStream|async` in the local variable `user`.
 *  - The local `user` can then be bound repeatedly in a more efficient way.
 *  - No need to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties as `ngIf` will only
 *    display the data if `userStream` returns a value.
 *  - We can display an alternative template while waiting for the data.
 *
 * ### Syntax
 *
 * Simple form:
 * - `<div *ngIf="condition">...</div>`
 * - `<ng-template [ngIf]="condition"><div>...</div></ng-template>`
 *
 * Form with an else block:
 * ```
 * <div *ngIf="condition; else elseBlock">...</div>
 * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>
 * ```
 *
 * Form with a `then` and `else` block:
 * ```
 * <div *ngIf="condition; then thenBlock else elseBlock"></div>
 * <ng-template #thenBlock>...</ng-template>
 * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>
 * ```
 *
 * Form with storing the value locally:
 * ```
 * <div *ngIf="condition as value; else elseBlock">{{value}}</div>
 * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>
 * ```
 *
 *

 * WARNINGS:
 * - this pipe is marked as pure hence it will not be re-evaluated when the input is mutated.
 *   Instead users should treat the date as an immutable object and change the reference when the
 *   pipe needs to re-run (this is to avoid reformatting the date on every change detection run
 *   which would be an expensive operation).
 * - this pipe uses the Internationalization API. Therefore it is only reliable in Chrome and Opera
 *   browsers.

 * Assuming `dateObj` is (year: 2010, month: 9, day: 3, hour: 12 PM, minute: 05, second: 08)
 * in the _local_ time and locale is 'en-US':

/**
 * @ngModule CommonModule
 * @description
 *
 * Formats a date value according to locale rules.
 *
 * Only the `en-US` locale data comes with Angular. To localize dates
 * in another language, you must import the corresponding locale data.
 * See the [I18n guide](guide/i18n#i18n-pipes) for more information.
 *
 * @see `formatDate()`
 *
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * The result of this pipe is not reevaluated when the input is mutated. To avoid the need to
 * reformat the date on every change-detection cycle, treat the date as an immutable object
 * and change the reference when the pipe needs to run again.
 *
 * ### Pre-defined format options
 *
 * Examples are given in `en-US` locale.
 *
 * - `'short'`: equivalent to `'M/d/yy, h:mm a'` (`6/15/15, 9:03 AM`).
 * - `'medium'`: equivalent to `'MMM d, y, h:mm:ss a'` (`Jun 15, 2015, 9:03:01 AM`).
 * - `'long'`: equivalent to `'MMMM d, y, h:mm:ss a z'` (`June 15, 2015 at 9:03:01 AM
 * GMT+1`).
 * - `'full'`: equivalent to `'EEEE, MMMM d, y, h:mm:ss a zzzz'` (`Monday, June 15, 2015 at
 * 9:03:01 AM GMT+01:00`).
 * - `'shortDate'`: equivalent to `'M/d/yy'` (`6/15/15`).
 * - `'mediumDate'`: equivalent to `'MMM d, y'` (`Jun 15, 2015`).
 * - `'longDate'`: equivalent to `'MMMM d, y'` (`June 15, 2015`).
 * - `'fullDate'`: equivalent to `'EEEE, MMMM d, y'` (`Monday, June 15, 2015`).
 * - `'shortTime'`: equivalent to `'h:mm a'` (`9:03 AM`).
 * - `'mediumTime'`: equivalent to `'h:mm:ss a'` (`9:03:01 AM`).
 * - `'longTime'`: equivalent to `'h:mm:ss a z'` (`9:03:01 AM GMT+1`).
 * - `'fullTime'`: equivalent to `'h:mm:ss a zzzz'` (`9:03:01 AM GMT+01:00`).
 *
 * ### Custom format options
 *
 * You can construct a format string using symbols to specify the components
 * of a date-time value, as described in the following table.
 * Format details depend on the locale.
 * Fields marked with (*) are only available in the extra data set for the given locale.

 * Note that timezone correction is not applied to an ISO string that has no time component, such as "2016-09-19"
 *
 * ### Format examples
 *
 * These examples transform a date into various formats,
 * assuming that `dateObj` is a JavaScript `Date` object for
 * year: 2015, month: 6, day: 15, hour: 21, minute: 43, second: 11,
 * given in the local time for the `en-US` locale.
 *
 * ```
 * {{ dateObj | date }}               // output is 'Jun 15, 2015'
 * {{ dateObj | date:'medium' }}      // output is 'Jun 15, 2015, 9:43:11 PM'
 * {{ dateObj | date:'shortTime' }}   // output is '9:43 PM'
 * {{ dateObj | date:'mmss' }}        // output is '43:11'
 * ```
 *
 * ### Usage example
 *
 * The following component uses a date pipe to display the current date in different formats.
 *
 * ```
 * @Component({
 *  selector: 'date-pipe',
 *  template: `<div>
 *    <p>Today is {{today | date}}</p>
 *    <p>Or if you prefer, {{today | date:'fullDate'}}</p>
 *    <p>The time is {{today | date:'h:mm a z'}}</p>
 *  </div>`
 * })
 * // Get the current date and time as a date-time value.
 * export class DatePipeComponent {
 *   today: number = Date.now();
 * }
 * ```
 *

 * Creates a token that can be used in a DI Provider.
 *
 * Use an `InjectionToken` whenever the type you are injecting is not reified (does not have a
 * runtime representation) such as when injecting an interface, callable type, array or
 * parametrized type.
 *
 * `InjectionToken` is parameterized on `T` which is the type of object which will be returned by
 * the `Injector`. This provides additional level of type safety.
 *
 * ```
 * interface MyInterface {...}
 * var myInterface = injector.get(new InjectionToken<MyInterface>('SomeToken'));
 * // myInterface is inferred to be MyInterface.
 * ```
 *
 * When creating an `InjectionToken`, you can optionally specify a factory function which returns
 * (possibly by creating) a default value of the parameterized type `T`. This sets up the
 * `InjectionToken` using this factory as a provider as if it was defined explicitly in the
 * application's root injector. If the factory function, which takes zero arguments, needs to inject
 * dependencies, it can do so using the `inject` function. See below for an example.
 *
 * Additionally, if a `factory` is specified you can also specify the `providedIn` option, which
 * overrides the above behavior and marks the token as belonging to a particular `@NgModule`. As
 * mentioned above, `'root'` is the default value for `providedIn`.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * ### Basic Example
 *
 * #### Plain InjectionToken
 *
 * {@example core/di/ts/injector_spec.ts region='InjectionToken'}
 *
 * #### Tree-shakable InjectionToken
 *

/**
 * Component decorator and metadata.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Using animations
 *
 * The following snippet shows an animation trigger in a component's
 * metadata. The trigger is attached to an element in the component's
 * template, using "@_trigger_name_", and a state expression that is evaluated
 * at run time to determine whether the animation should start.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * @Component({
 *   selector: 'animation-cmp',
 *   templateUrl: 'animation-cmp.html',
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger('myTriggerName', [
 *       state('on', style({ opacity: 1 }),
 *       state('off', style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *       transition('on => off', [
 *         animate("1s")
 *       ])
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- animation-cmp.html -->
 * <div @myTriggerName="expression">...</div>
 * ```
 *
 * ### Preserving whitespace
 *
 * Removing whitespace can greatly reduce AOT-generated code size, and speed up view creation.
 * As of Angular 6, default for `preserveWhitespaces` is false (whitespace is removed).
 * To change the default setting for all components in your application, set
 * the `preserveWhitespaces` option of the AOT compiler.
 *
 * Current implementation removes whitespace characters as follows:
 * - Trims all whitespaces at the beginning and the end of a template.
 * - Removes whitespace-only text nodes. For example,
 * `<button>Action 1</button>  <button>Action 2</button>` becomes
 * `<button>Action 1</button><button>Action 2</button>`.
 * - Replaces a series of whitespace characters in text nodes with a single space.
 * For example, `<span>\n some text\n</span>` becomes `<span> some text </span>`.
 * - Does NOT alter text nodes inside HTML tags such as `<pre>` or `<textarea>`,
 * where whitespace characters are significant.
 *
 * Note that these transformations can influence DOM nodes layout, although impact
 * should be minimal.
 *
 * You can override the default behavior to preserve whitespace characters
 * in certain fragments of a template. For example, you can exclude an entire
 * DOM sub-tree by using the `ngPreserveWhitespaces` attribute:
 *
 * ```html
 * <div ngPreserveWhitespaces>
 *     whitespaces are preserved here
 *     <span>    and here </span>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * You can force a single space to be preserved in a text node by using `&ngsp;`,
 * which is replaced with a space character by Angular's template
 * compiler:
 *
 * ```html
 * <a>Spaces</a>&ngsp;<a>between</a>&ngsp;<a>links.</a>
 * <!-->compiled to be equivalent to:</>
 *  <a>Spaces</a> <a>between</a> <a>links.</a>
 * ```
 *
 * Note that sequences of `&ngsp;` are still collapsed to just one space character when
 * the `preserveWhitespaces` option is set to `false`.
 *
 * ```html
 * <a>before</a>&ngsp;&ngsp;&ngsp;<a>after</a>
 * <!-->compiled to be equivalent to:</>
 *  <a>Spaces</a> <a>between</a> <a>links.</a>
 * ```
 *
 * To preserve sequences of whitespace characters, use the
 * `ngPreserveWhitespaces` attribute.

/**
 * A ReflectiveDependency injection container used for instantiating objects and resolving
 * dependencies.
 *
 * An `Injector` is a replacement for a `new` operator, which can automatically resolve the
 * constructor dependencies.
 *
 * In typical use, application code asks for the dependencies in the constructor and they are
 * resolved by the `Injector`.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * ### Example
 *
 * The following example creates an `Injector` configured to create `Engine` and `Car`.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * @Injectable()
 * class Engine {
 * }
 *
 * @Injectable()
 * class Car {
 *   constructor(public engine:Engine) {}
 * }
 *
 * var injector = ReflectiveInjector.resolveAndCreate([Car, Engine]);
 * var car = injector.get(Car);
 * expect(car instanceof Car).toBe(true);
 * expect(car.engine instanceof Engine).toBe(true);
 * ```
 *
 * Notice, we don't use the `new` operator because we explicitly want to have the `Injector`
 * resolve all of the object's dependencies automatically.
 *
 * @deprecated from v5 - slow and brings in a lot of code, Use `Injector.create` instead.

/**
 * Base class for Angular Views, provides change detection functionality.
 * A change-detection tree collects all views that are to be checked for changes.
 * Use the methods to add and remove views from the tree, initiate change-detection,
 * and explicitly mark views as _dirty_, meaning that they have changed and need to be rerendered.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * The following examples demonstrate how to modify default change-detection behavior
 * to perform explicit detection when needed.
 *
 * ### Use `markForCheck()` with `CheckOnce` strategy
 *
 * The following example sets the `OnPush` change-detection strategy for a component
 * (`CheckOnce`, rather than the default `CheckAlways`), then forces a second check
 * after an interval. See [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/GC512b?p=preview).
 *
 * <code-example path="core/ts/change_detect/change-detection.ts"
 * region="mark-for-check"></code-example>
 *
 * ### Detach change detector to limit how often check occurs
 *
 * The following example defines a component with a large list of read-only data
 * that is expected to change constantly, many times per second.
 * To improve performance, we want to check and update the list
 * less often than the changes actually occur. To do that, we detach
 * the component's change detector and perform an explicit local check every five seconds.
 *
 * <code-example path="core/ts/change_detect/change-detection.ts" region="detach"></code-example>
 *
 *
 * ### Reattaching a detached component
 *
 * The following example creates a component displaying live data.
 * The component detaches its change detector from the main change detector tree
 * when the `live` property is set to false, and reattaches it when the property
 * becomes true.
 *
 * <code-example path="core/ts/change_detect/change-detection.ts" region="detach"></code-example>

/**
 * Represents an Angular View.
 *
 * <!-- TODO: move the next two paragraphs to the dev guide -->
 * A View is a fundamental building block of the application UI. It is the smallest grouping of
 * Elements which are created and destroyed together.
 *
 * Properties of elements in a View can change, but the structure (number and order) of elements in
 * a View cannot. Changing the structure of Elements can only be done by inserting, moving or
 * removing nested Views via a `ViewContainerRef`. Each View can contain many View Containers.
 * <!-- /TODO -->
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * ### Example
 *
 * Given this template...
 *
 * ```
 * Count: {{items.length}}
 * <ul>
 *   <li *ngFor="let  item of items">{{item}}</li>
 * </ul>
 * ```
 *
 * We have two `TemplateRef`s:
 *
 * Outer `TemplateRef`:
 *
 * ```
 * Count: {{items.length}}
 * <ul>
 *   <ng-template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]="items"></ng-template>
 * </ul>
 * ```
 *
 * Inner `TemplateRef`:
 *
 * ```
 *   <li>{{item}}</li>
 * ```
 *
 * Notice that the original template is broken down into two separate `TemplateRef`s.
 *
 * The outer/inner `TemplateRef`s are then assembled into views like so:
 *
 * ```
 * <!-- ViewRef: outer-0 -->
 * Count: 2
 * <ul>
 *   <ng-template view-container-ref></ng-template>
 *   <!-- ViewRef: inner-1 --><li>first</li><!-- /ViewRef: inner-1 -->
 *   <!-- ViewRef: inner-2 --><li>second</li><!-- /ViewRef: inner-2 -->
 * </ul>
 * <!-- /ViewRef: outer-0 -->

 * (1) Either a protocol in a whitelist (http, https, mailto or ftp).
 * (2) or no protocol.  A protocol must be followed by a colon. The below

 *
 * The pattern disallows &, used in HTML entity declarations before
 * one of the characters in [/?#]. This disallows HTML entities used in the
 * protocol name, which should never happen, e.g. "h&#116;tp" for "http".
 * It also disallows HTML entities in the first path part of a relative path,

// This function calls the ngAfterContentCheck, ngAfterContentInit,
// ngAfterViewCheck, and ngAfterViewInit lifecycle hooks (depending on the node
// flags in lifecycle). Unlike ngDoCheck, ngOnChanges and ngOnInit, which are
// called during a pre-order traversal of the view tree (that is calling the
// parent hooks before the child hooks) these events are sent in using a
// post-order traversal of the tree (children before parents). This changes the
// meaning of initIndex in the view state. For ngOnInit, initIndex tracks the
// expected nodeIndex which a ngOnInit should be called. When sending
// ngAfterContentInit and ngAfterViewInit it is the expected count of
// ngAfterContentInit or ngAfterViewInit methods that have been called. This
// ensure that despite being called recursively or after picking up after an
// exception, the ngAfterContentInit or ngAfterViewInit will be called on the
// correct nodes. Consider for example, the following (where E is an element
// and D is a directive)
//  Tree:       pre-order index  post-order index
//    E1        0                6
//      E2      1                1
//       D3     2                0
//      E4      3                5
//       E5     4                4
//        E6    5                2
//        E7    6                3
// As can be seen, the post-order index has an unclear relationship to the
// pre-order index (postOrderIndex === preOrderIndex - parentCount +
// childCount). Since number of calls to ngAfterContentInit and ngAfterViewInit
// are stable (will be the same for the same view regardless of exceptions or
// recursion) we just need to count them which will roughly correspond to the
// post-order index (it skips elements and directives that do not have
// lifecycle hooks).
//
// For example, if an exception is raised in the E6.onAfterViewInit() the
// initIndex is left at 3 (by shouldCallLifecycleInitHook() which set it to
// initIndex + 1). When checkAndUpdateView() is called again D3, E2 and E6 will
// not have their ngAfterViewInit() called but, starting with E7, the rest of
// the view will begin getting ngAfterViewInit() called until a check and
// pass is complete.
//
// This algorthim also handles recursion. Consider if E4's ngAfterViewInit()
// indirectly calls E1's ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges(). The expected
// initIndex is set to 6, the recusive checkAndUpdateView() starts walk again.
// D3, E2, E6, E7, E5 and E4 are skipped, ngAfterViewInit() is called on E1.
// When the recursion returns the initIndex will be 7 so E1 is skipped as it
// has already been called in the recursively called checkAnUpdateView().

 * If you have imported the `FormsModule` or the `ReactiveFormsModule`, this
 * value accessor will be active on any radio control that has a form directive. You do
 * **not** need to add a special selector to activate it.
 *
 * ### How to use radio buttons with form directives
 *
 * To use radio buttons in a template-driven form, you'll want to ensure that radio buttons
 * in the same group have the same `name` attribute.  Radio buttons with different `name`
 * attributes do not affect each other.
 *
 * {@example forms/ts/radioButtons/radio_button_example.ts region='TemplateDriven'}
 *
 * When using radio buttons in a reactive form, radio buttons in the same group should have the
 * same `formControlName`. You can also add a `name` attribute, but it's optional.
 *
 * {@example forms/ts/reactiveRadioButtons/reactive_radio_button_example.ts region='Reactive'}
 *
 *  * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`
 *

/**
 * @description
 *
 * Writes values and listens to changes on a select element.
 *
 * Used by `NgModel`, `FormControlDirective`, and `FormControlName`
 * to keep the view synced with the `FormControl` model.
 *
 * If you have imported the `FormsModule` or the `ReactiveFormsModule`, this
 * value accessor will be active on any select control that has a form directive. You do
 * **not** need to add a special selector to activate it.
 *
 * ### How to use select controls with form directives
 *
 * To use a select in a template-driven form, simply add an `ngModel` and a `name`
 * attribute to the main `<select>` tag.
 *
 * If your option values are simple strings, you can bind to the normal `value` property
 * on the option.  If your option values happen to be objects (and you'd like to save the
 * selection in your form as an object), use `ngValue` instead:
 *
 * {@example forms/ts/selectControl/select_control_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * In reactive forms, you'll also want to add your form directive (`formControlName` or
 * `formControl`) on the main `<select>` tag. Like in the former example, you have the
 * choice of binding to the  `value` or `ngValue` property on the select's options.
 *
 * {@example forms/ts/reactiveSelectControl/reactive_select_control_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * ### Caveat: Option selection
 *
 * Angular uses object identity to select option. It's possible for the identities of items
 * to change while the data does not. This can happen, for example, if the items are produced
 * from an RPC to the server, and that RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the
 * second response will produce objects with different identities.
 *
 * To customize the default option comparison algorithm, `<select>` supports `compareWith` input.
 * `compareWith` takes a **function** which has two arguments: `option1` and `option2`.
 * If `compareWith` is given, Angular selects option by the return value of the function.
 *
 * #### Syntax
 *
 * ```
 * <select [compareWith]="compareFn"  [(ngModel)]="selectedCountries">
 *     <option *ngFor="let country of countries" [ngValue]="country">
 *         {{country.name}}
 *     </option>
 * </select>
 *
 * compareFn(c1: Country, c2: Country): boolean {
 *     return c1 && c2 ? c1.id === c2.id : c1 === c2;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Note: We listen to the 'change' event because 'input' events aren't fired
 * for selects in Firefox and IE:
 * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1024350
 * https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/4660045/
 *
 * * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`

 * to change while the data does not. This can happen, for example, if the items are produced
 * from an RPC to the server, and that RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the
 * second response will produce objects with different identities.
 *
 * To customize the default option comparison algorithm, `<select multiple>` supports `compareWith`
 * input. `compareWith` takes a **function** which has two arguments: `option1` and `option2`.
 * If `compareWith` is given, Angular selects options by the return value of the function.
 *
 * #### Syntax
 *
 * ```
 * <select multiple [compareWith]="compareFn"  [(ngModel)]="selectedCountries">
 *     <option *ngFor="let country of countries" [ngValue]="country">
 *         {{country.name}}
 *     </option>
 * </select>
 *
 * compareFn(c1: Country, c2: Country): boolean {
 *     return c1 && c2 ? c1.id === c2.id : c1 === c2;
 * }
 * ```
 *

/**
 * Tracks the value and validation status of an individual form control.
 *
 * This is one of the three fundamental building blocks of Angular forms, along with
 * `FormGroup` and `FormArray`. It extends the `AbstractControl` class that
 * implements most of the base functionality for accessing the value, validation status,
 * user interactions and events.
 *
 * @see `AbstractControl`
 * @see [Reactive Forms Guide](guide/reactive-forms)
 * @see [Usage Notes](#usage-notes)
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Initializing Form Controls
 *
 * Instantiate a `FormControl`, with an initial value.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const control = new FormControl('some value');
 * console.log(control.value);     // 'some value'
 *```
 *
 * The following example initializes the control with a form state object. The `value`
 * and `disabled` keys are required in this case.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const control = new FormControl({ value: 'n/a', disabled: true });
 * console.log(control.value);     // 'n/a'
 * console.log(control.status);    // 'DISABLED'
 * ```
 *
 * The following example initializes the control with a sync validator.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const control = new FormControl('', Validators.required);
 * console.log(control.value);      // ''
 * console.log(control.status);     // 'INVALID'
 * ```
 *
 * The following example initializes the control using an options object.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const control = new FormControl('', {
 *    validators: Validators.required,
 *    asyncValidators: myAsyncValidator
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Configure the control to update on a blur event
 *
 * Set the `updateOn` option to `'blur'` to update on the blur `event`.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const control = new FormControl('', { updateOn: 'blur' });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Configure the control to update on a submit event
 *
 * Set the `updateOn` option to `'submit'` to update on a submit `event`.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const control = new FormControl('', { updateOn: 'submit' });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Reset the control back to an initial value
 *
 * You reset to a specific form state by passing through a standalone
 * value or a form state object that contains both a value and a disabled state
 * (these are the only two properties that cannot be calculated).
 *
 * ```ts
 * const control = new FormControl('Nancy');
 *
 * console.log(control.value); // 'Nancy'
 *
 * control.reset('Drew');
 *
 * console.log(control.value); // 'Drew'
 * ```
 *
 * ### Reset the control back to an initial value and disabled
 *
 * ```
 * const control = new FormControl('Nancy');
 *
 * console.log(control.value); // 'Nancy'
 * console.log(control.status); // 'VALID'
 *
 * control.reset({ value: 'Drew', disabled: true });
 *
 * console.log(control.value); // 'Drew'
 * console.log(control.status); // 'DISABLED'
 *

/**
 * Tracks the value and validity state of a group of `FormControl` instances.
 *
 * A `FormGroup` aggregates the values of each child `FormControl` into one object,
 * with each control name as the key.  It calculates its status by reducing the status values
 * of its children. For example, if one of the controls in a group is invalid, the entire
 * group becomes invalid.
 *
 * `FormGroup` is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular,
 * along with `FormControl` and `FormArray`.
 *
 * When instantiating a `FormGroup`, pass in a collection of child controls as the first
 * argument. The key for each child registers the name for the control.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Create a form group with 2 controls
 *
 * ```
 * const form = new FormGroup({
 *   first: new FormControl('Nancy', Validators.minLength(2)),
 *   last: new FormControl('Drew'),
 * });
 *
 * console.log(form.value);   // {first: 'Nancy', last; 'Drew'}
 * console.log(form.status);  // 'VALID'
 * ```
 *
 * ### Create a form group with a group-level validator
 *
 * You include group-level validators as the second arg, or group-level async
 * validators as the third arg. These come in handy when you want to perform validation
 * that considers the value of more than one child control.
 *
 * ```
 * const form = new FormGroup({
 *   password: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),
 *   passwordConfirm: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),
 * }, passwordMatchValidator);
 *
 *
 * function passwordMatchValidator(g: FormGroup) {
 *    return g.get('password').value === g.get('passwordConfirm').value
 *       ? null : {'mismatch': true};
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Like `FormControl` instances, you choose to pass in
 * validators and async validators as part of an options object.
 *
 * ```
 * const form = new FormGroup({
 *   password: new FormControl('')
 *   passwordConfirm: new FormControl('')
 * }, { validators: passwordMatchValidator, asyncValidators: otherValidator });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Set the updateOn property for all controls in a form group
 *
 * The options object is used to set a default value for each child
 * control's `updateOn` property. If you set `updateOn` to `'blur'` at the
 * group level, all child controls default to 'blur', unless the child
 * has explicitly specified a different `updateOn` value.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const c = new FormGroup({
 *   one: new FormControl()
 * }, { updateOn: 'blur' });
 * ```

/**
 * Tracks the value and validity state of an array of `FormControl`,
 * `FormGroup` or `FormArray` instances.
 *
 * A `FormArray` aggregates the values of each child `FormControl` into an array.
 * It calculates its status by reducing the status values of its children. For example, if one of
 * the controls in a `FormArray` is invalid, the entire array becomes invalid.
 *
 * `FormArray` is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular,
 * along with `FormControl` and `FormGroup`.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Create an array of form controls
 *
 * ```
 * const arr = new FormArray([
 *   new FormControl('Nancy', Validators.minLength(2)),
 *   new FormControl('Drew'),
 * ]);
 *
 * console.log(arr.value);   // ['Nancy', 'Drew']
 * console.log(arr.status);  // 'VALID'
 * ```
 *
 * ### Create a form array with array-level validators
 *
 * You include array-level validators and async validators. These come in handy
 * when you want to perform validation that considers the value of more than one child
 * control.
 *
 * The two types of validators are passed in separately as the second and third arg
 * respectively, or together as part of an options object.
 *
 * ```
 * const arr = new FormArray([
 *   new FormControl('Nancy'),
 *   new FormControl('Drew')
 * ], {validators: myValidator, asyncValidators: myAsyncValidator});
 * ```
 *
  * ### Set the updateOn property for all controls in a form array
 *
 * The options object is used to set a default value for each child
 * control's `updateOn` property. If you set `updateOn` to `'blur'` at the
 * array level, all child controls default to 'blur', unless the child
 * has explicitly specified a different `updateOn` value.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const arr = new FormArray([
 *    new FormControl()
 * ], {updateOn: 'blur'});
 * ```
 *
 * ### Adding or removing controls from a form array
 *
 * To change the controls in the array, use the `push`, `insert`, or `removeAt` methods
 * in `FormArray` itself. These methods ensure the controls are properly tracked in the
 * form's hierarchy. Do not modify the array of `AbstractControl`s used to instantiate
 * the `FormArray` directly, as that result in strange and unexpected behavior such
 * as broken change detection.

/**
 * @description
 *
 * Creates a top-level `FormGroup` instance and binds it to a form
 * to track aggregate form value and validation status.
 *
 * As soon as you import the `FormsModule`, this directive becomes active by default on
 * all `<form>` tags.  You don't need to add a special selector.
 *
 * You can export the directive into a local template variable using `ngForm` as the key
 * (ex: `#myForm="ngForm"`). This is optional, but useful.  Many properties from the underlying
 * `FormGroup` instance are duplicated on the directive itself, so a reference to it
 * will give you access to the aggregate value and validity status of the form, as well as
 * user interaction properties like `dirty` and `touched`.
 *
 * To register child controls with the form, you'll want to use `NgModel` with a
 * `name` attribute.  You can also use `NgModelGroup` if you'd like to create
 * sub-groups within the form.
 *
 * You can listen to the directive's `ngSubmit` event to be notified when the user has
 * triggered a form submission. The `ngSubmit` event will be emitted with the original form
 * submission event.
 *
 * In template driven forms, all `<form>` tags are automatically tagged as `NgForm`.
 * If you want to import the `FormsModule` but skip its usage in some forms,
 * for example, to use native HTML5 validation, you can add `ngNoForm` and the `<form>`
 * tags won't create an `NgForm` directive. In reactive forms, using `ngNoForm` is
 * unnecessary because the `<form>` tags are inert. In that case, you would
 * refrain from using the `formGroup` directive.

 *
 * Creates a `FormControl` instance from a domain model and binds it
 * to a form control element.
 *
 * The `FormControl` instance will track the value, user interaction, and
 * validation status of the control and keep the view synced with the model. If used
 * within a parent form, the directive will also register itself with the form as a child
 * control.
 *
 * This directive can be used by itself or as part of a larger form. All you need is the
 * `ngModel` selector to activate it.
 *
 * It accepts a domain model as an optional `Input`. If you have a one-way binding
 * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the value of the domain model in the component
 * class will set the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax
 * (also known as 'banana-box syntax'), the value in the UI will always be synced back to
 * the domain model in your class as well.
 *
 * If you wish to inspect the properties of the associated `FormControl` (like
 * validity state), you can also export the directive into a local template variable using
 * `ngModel` as the key (ex: `#myVar="ngModel"`). You can then access the control using the
 * directive's `control` property, but most properties you'll need (like `valid` and `dirty`)
 * will fall through to the control anyway, so you can access them directly. You can see a
 * full list of properties directly available in `AbstractControlDirective`.
 *
 * The following is an example of a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:
 *
 * {@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute
 * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.
 *
 * It's worth noting that in the context of a parent form, you often can skip one-way or
 * two-way binding because the parent form will sync the value for you. You can access
 * its properties by exporting it into a local template variable using `ngForm` (ex:
 * `#f="ngForm"`). Then you can pass it where it needs to go on submit.
 *
 * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for
 * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather
 * than the domain model's value on submit.
 *
 * Take a look at an example of using `ngModel` within a form:
 *
 * {@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * To see `ngModel` examples with different form control types, see:
 *
 * * Radio buttons: `RadioControlValueAccessor`
 * * Selects: `SelectControlValueAccessor`

/**
 * @description
 *
 * Syncs a standalone `FormControl` instance to a form control element.
 *
 * This directive ensures that any values written to the `FormControl`
 * instance programmatically will be written to the DOM element (model -> view). Conversely,
 * any values written to the DOM element through user input will be reflected in the
 * `FormControl` instance (view -> model).
 *
 * Use this directive if you'd like to create and manage a `FormControl` instance directly.
 * Simply create a `FormControl`, save it to your component class, and pass it into the
 * `FormControlDirective`.
 *
 * This directive is designed to be used as a standalone control.  Unlike `FormControlName`,
 * it does not require that your `FormControl` instance be part of any parent
 * `FormGroup`, and it won't be registered to any `FormGroupDirective` that
 * exists above it.
 *
 * **Get the value**: the `value` property is always synced and available on the
 * `FormControl` instance. See a full list of available properties in
 * `AbstractControl`.
 *
 * **Set the value**: You can pass in an initial value when instantiating the `FormControl`,
 * or you can set it programmatically later using {@link AbstractControl#setValue setValue} or
 * {@link AbstractControl#patchValue patchValue}.
 *
 * **Listen to value**: If you want to listen to changes in the value of the control, you can
 * subscribe to the {@link AbstractControl#valueChanges valueChanges} event.  You can also listen to
 * {@link AbstractControl#statusChanges statusChanges} to be notified when the validation status is
 * re-calculated.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * {@example forms/ts/simpleFormControl/simple_form_control_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`
 *
 * * **NgModule**: `ReactiveFormsModule`
 *
 * ### Use with ngModel
 *
 * Support for using the `ngModel` input property and `ngModelChange` event with reactive
 * form directives has been deprecated in Angular v6 and will be removed in Angular v7.
 *
 * Now deprecated:
 * ```html
 * <input [formControl]="control" [(ngModel)]="value">
 * ```
 *
 * ```ts
 * this.value = 'some value';
 * ```
 *
 * This has been deprecated for a few reasons. First, developers have found this pattern
 * confusing. It seems like the actual `ngModel` directive is being used, but in fact it's
 * an input/output property named `ngModel` on the reactive form directive that simply
 * approximates (some of) its behavior. Specifically, it allows getting/setting the value
 * and intercepting value events. However, some of `ngModel`'s other features - like
 * delaying updates with`ngModelOptions` or exporting the directive - simply don't work,
 * which has understandably caused some confusion.
 *
 * In addition, this pattern mixes template-driven and reactive forms strategies, which
 * we generally don't recommend because it doesn't take advantage of the full benefits of
 * either strategy. Setting the value in the template violates the template-agnostic
 * principles behind reactive forms, whereas adding a `FormControl`/`FormGroup` layer in
 * the class removes the convenience of defining forms in the template.
 *
 * To update your code before v7, you'll want to decide whether to stick with reactive form
 * directives (and get/set values using reactive forms patterns) or switch over to
 * template-driven directives.
 *
 * After (choice 1 - use reactive forms):
 *
 * ```html
 * <input [formControl]="control">
 * ```
 *
 * ```ts
 * this.control.setValue('some value');
 * ```
 *
 * After (choice 2 - use template-driven forms):
 *
 * ```html
 * <input [(ngModel)]="value">
 * ```
 *
 * ```ts
 * this.value = 'some value';
 * ```
 *
 * By default, when you use this pattern, you will see a deprecation warning once in dev
 * mode. You can choose to silence this warning by providing a config for
 * `ReactiveFormsModule` at import time:
 *
 * ```ts
 * imports: [
 *   ReactiveFormsModule.withConfig({warnOnNgModelWithFormControl: 'never'});
 * ]
 * ```
 *
 * Alternatively, you can choose to surface a separate warning for each instance of this
 * pattern with a config value of `"always"`. This may help to track down where in the code
 * the pattern is being used as the code is being updated.

/**
 * @description
 *
 * Syncs a nested `FormArray` to a DOM element.
 *
 * This directive is designed to be used with a parent `FormGroupDirective` (selector:
 * `[formGroup]`).
 *
 * It accepts the string name of the nested `FormArray` you want to link, and
 * will look for a `FormArray` registered with that name in the parent
 * `FormGroup` instance you passed into `FormGroupDirective`.
 *
 * Nested form arrays can come in handy when you have a group of form controls but
 * you're not sure how many there will be. Form arrays allow you to create new
 * form controls dynamically.
 *
 * **Access the array**: You can access the associated `FormArray` using the
 * {@link AbstractControl#get get} method on the parent `FormGroup`.
 * Ex: `this.form.get('cities')`.
 *
 * **Get the value**: the `value` property is always synced and available on the
 * `FormArray`. See a full list of available properties in `AbstractControl`.
 *
 * **Set the value**: You can set an initial value for each child control when instantiating
 * the `FormArray`, or you can set the value programmatically later using the
 * `FormArray`'s {@link AbstractControl#setValue setValue} or
 * {@link AbstractControl#patchValue patchValue} methods.
 *
 * **Listen to value**: If you want to listen to changes in the value of the array, you can
 * subscribe to the `FormArray`'s {@link AbstractControl#valueChanges valueChanges} event.
 * You can also listen to its {@link AbstractControl#statusChanges statusChanges} event to be
 * notified when the validation status is re-calculated.
 *
 * **Add new controls**: You can add new controls to the `FormArray` dynamically by calling
 * its {@link FormArray#push push} method.
 * Ex: `this.form.get('cities').push(new FormControl());`
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * {@example forms/ts/nestedFormArray/nested_form_array_example.ts region='Component'}

 * * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`

/**
 * @description
 *
 * Syncs a `FormControl` in an existing `FormGroup` to a form control
 * element by name.
 *
 * This directive ensures that any values written to the `FormControl`
 * instance programmatically will be written to the DOM element (model -> view). Conversely,
 * any values written to the DOM element through user input will be reflected in the
 * `FormControl` instance (view -> model).
 *
 * This directive is designed to be used with a parent `FormGroupDirective` (selector:
 * `[formGroup]`).
 *
 * It accepts the string name of the `FormControl` instance you want to
 * link, and will look for a `FormControl` registered with that name in the
 * closest `FormGroup` or `FormArray` above it.
 *
 * **Access the control**: You can access the `FormControl` associated with
 * this directive by using the {@link AbstractControl#get get} method.
 * Ex: `this.form.get('first');`
 *
 * **Get value**: the `value` property is always synced and available on the `FormControl`.
 * See a full list of available properties in `AbstractControl`.
 *
 *  **Set value**: You can set an initial value for the control when instantiating the
 *  `FormControl`, or you can set it programmatically later using
 *  {@link AbstractControl#setValue setValue} or {@link AbstractControl#patchValue patchValue}.
 *
 * **Listen to value**: If you want to listen to changes in the value of the control, you can
 * subscribe to the {@link AbstractControl#valueChanges valueChanges} event.  You can also listen to
 * {@link AbstractControl#statusChanges statusChanges} to be notified when the validation status is
 * re-calculated.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * In this example, we create form controls for first name and last name.
 *
 * {@example forms/ts/simpleFormGroup/simple_form_group_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * To see `formControlName` examples with different form control types, see:
 *
 * * Radio buttons: `RadioControlValueAccessor`
 * * Selects: `SelectControlValueAccessor`
 *
 * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`
 *
 * **NgModule**: `ReactiveFormsModule`
 *
 * ### Use with ngModel
 *
 * Support for using the `ngModel` input property and `ngModelChange` event with reactive
 * form directives has been deprecated in Angular v6 and will be removed in Angular v7.
 *
 * Now deprecated:
 * ```html
 * <form [formGroup]="form">
 *   <input formControlName="first" [(ngModel)]="value">
 * </form>
 * ```
 *
 * ```ts
 * this.value = 'some value';
 * ```
 *
 * This has been deprecated for a few reasons. First, developers have found this pattern
 * confusing. It seems like the actual `ngModel` directive is being used, but in fact it's
 * an input/output property named `ngModel` on the reactive form directive that simply
 * approximates (some of) its behavior. Specifically, it allows getting/setting the value
 * and intercepting value events. However, some of `ngModel`'s other features - like
 * delaying updates with`ngModelOptions` or exporting the directive - simply don't work,
 * which has understandably caused some confusion.
 *
 * In addition, this pattern mixes template-driven and reactive forms strategies, which
 * we generally don't recommend because it doesn't take advantage of the full benefits of
 * either strategy. Setting the value in the template violates the template-agnostic
 * principles behind reactive forms, whereas adding a `FormControl`/`FormGroup` layer in
 * the class removes the convenience of defining forms in the template.
 *
 * To update your code before v7, you'll want to decide whether to stick with reactive form
 * directives (and get/set values using reactive forms patterns) or switch over to
 * template-driven directives.
 *
 * After (choice 1 - use reactive forms):
 *
 * ```html
 * <form [formGroup]="form">
 *   <input formControlName="first">
 * </form>
 * ```
 *
 * ```ts
 * this.form.get('first').setValue('some value');
 * ```
 *
 * After (choice 2 - use template-driven forms):
 *
 * ```html
 * <input [(ngModel)]="value">
 * ```
 *
 * ```ts
 * this.value = 'some value';
 * ```
 *
 * By default, when you use this pattern, you will see a deprecation warning once in dev
 * mode. You can choose to silence this warning by providing a config for
 * `ReactiveFormsModule` at import time:
 *
 * ```ts
 * imports: [
 *   ReactiveFormsModule.withConfig({warnOnNgModelWithFormControl: 'never'});
 * ]
 * ```
 *
 * Alternatively, you can choose to surface a separate warning for each instance of this
 * pattern with a config value of `"always"`. This may help to track down where in the code
 * the pattern is being used as the code is being updated.

/**
 * DomSanitizer helps preventing Cross Site Scripting Security bugs (XSS) by sanitizing
 * values to be safe to use in the different DOM contexts.
 *
 * For example, when binding a URL in an `<a [href]="someValue">` hyperlink, `someValue` will be
 * sanitized so that an attacker cannot inject e.g. a `javascript:` URL that would execute code on
 * the website.
 *
 * In specific situations, it might be necessary to disable sanitization, for example if the
 * application genuinely needs to produce a `javascript:` style link with a dynamic value in it.
 * Users can bypass security by constructing a value with one of the `bypassSecurityTrust...`
 * methods, and then binding to that value from the template.
 *
 * These situations should be very rare, and extraordinary care must be taken to avoid creating a
 * Cross Site Scripting (XSS) security bug!
 *
 * When using `bypassSecurityTrust...`, make sure to call the method as early as possible and as
 * close as possible to the source of the value, to make it easy to verify no security bug is
 * created by its use.
 *
 * It is not required (and not recommended) to bypass security if the value is safe, e.g. a URL that
 * does not start with a suspicious protocol, or an HTML snippet that does not contain dangerous
 * code. The sanitizer leaves safe values intact.
 *
 * @security Calling any of the `bypassSecurityTrust...` APIs disables Angular's built-in
 * sanitization for the value passed in. Carefully check and audit all values and code paths going
 * into this call. Make sure any user data is appropriately escaped for this security context.

/**
 * @description
 *
 * Lets you link to specific routes in your app.
 *
 * Consider the following route configuration:
 * `[{ path: 'user/:name', component: UserCmp }]`.
 * When linking to this `user/:name` route, you use the `RouterLink` directive.
 *
 * If the link is static, you can use the directive as follows:
 * `<a routerLink="/user/bob">link to user component</a>`
 *
 * If you use dynamic values to generate the link, you can pass an array of path
 * segments, followed by the params for each segment.
 *
 * For instance `['/team', teamId, 'user', userName, {details: true}]`
 * means that we want to generate a link to `/team/11/user/bob;details=true`.
 *
 * Multiple static segments can be merged into one
 * (e.g., `['/team/11/user', userName, {details: true}]`).
 *
 * The first segment name can be prepended with `/`, `./`, or `../`:
 * * If the first segment begins with `/`, the router will look up the route from the root of the
 *   app.
 * * If the first segment begins with `./`, or doesn't begin with a slash, the router will
 *   instead look in the children of the current activated route.
 * * And if the first segment begins with `../`, the router will go up one level.
 *
 * You can set query params and fragment as follows:
 *
 * ```
 * <a [routerLink]="['/user/bob']" [queryParams]="{debug: true}" fragment="education">
 *   link to user component
 * </a>
 * ```
 * RouterLink will use these to generate this link: `/user/bob#education?debug=true`.
 *
 * (Deprecated in v4.0.0 use `queryParamsHandling` instead) You can also tell the
 * directive to preserve the current query params and fragment:
 *
 * ```
 * <a [routerLink]="['/user/bob']" preserveQueryParams preserveFragment>
 *   link to user component
 * </a>
 * ```
 *
 * You can tell the directive to how to handle queryParams, available options are:
 *  - `'merge'`: merge the queryParams into the current queryParams
 *  - `'preserve'`: preserve the current queryParams
 *  - default/`''`: use the queryParams only
 *
 * Same options for {@link NavigationExtras#queryParamsHandling
 * NavigationExtras#queryParamsHandling}.
 *
 * ```
 * <a [routerLink]="['/user/bob']" [queryParams]="{debug: true}" queryParamsHandling="merge">
 *   link to user component
 * </a>
 * ```
 *
 * The router link directive always treats the provided input as a delta to the current url.
 *
 * For instance, if the current url is `/user/(box//aux:team)`.
 *
 * Then the following link `<a [routerLink]="['/user/jim']">Jim</a>` will generate the link
 * `/user/(jim//aux:team)`.
 *
 * See {@link Router#createUrlTree createUrlTree} for more information.
 *
 * @ngModule RouterModule

 * @description
 *
 * Lets you add a CSS class to an element when the link's route becomes active.
 *
 * This directive lets you add a CSS class to an element when the link's route
 * becomes active.
 *
 * Consider the following example:
 *
 * ```
 * <a routerLink="/user/bob" routerLinkActive="active-link">Bob</a>
 * ```
 *
 * When the url is either '/user' or '/user/bob', the active-link class will
 * be added to the `a` tag. If the url changes, the class will be removed.
 *
 * You can set more than one class, as follows:
 *
 * ```
 * <a routerLink="/user/bob" routerLinkActive="class1 class2">Bob</a>
 * <a routerLink="/user/bob" [routerLinkActive]="['class1', 'class2']">Bob</a>
 * ```
 *
 * You can configure RouterLinkActive by passing `exact: true`. This will add the classes
 * only when the url matches the link exactly.
 *
 * ```
 * <a routerLink="/user/bob" routerLinkActive="active-link" [routerLinkActiveOptions]="{exact:
 * true}">Bob</a>
 * ```
 *
 * You can assign the RouterLinkActive instance to a template variable and directly check
 * the `isActive` status.
 * ```
 * <a routerLink="/user/bob" routerLinkActive #rla="routerLinkActive">
 *   Bob {{ rla.isActive ? '(already open)' : ''}}
 * </a>
 * ```
 *
 * Finally, you can apply the RouterLinkActive directive to an ancestor of a RouterLink.
 *
 * ```
 * <div routerLinkActive="active-link" [routerLinkActiveOptions]="{exact: true}">
 *   <a routerLink="/user/jim">Jim</a>
 *   <a routerLink="/user/bob">Bob</a>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * This will set the active-link class on the div tag if the url is either '/user/jim' or
 * '/user/bob'.

/**

 *
 * RouterModule can be imported multiple times: once per lazily-loaded bundle.
 * Since the router deals with a global shared resource--location, we cannot have
 * more than one router service active.
 *
 * That is why there are two ways to create the module: `RouterModule.forRoot` and
 * `RouterModule.forChild`.
 *
 * * `forRoot` creates a module that contains all the directives, the given routes, and the router
 *   service itself.
 * * `forChild` creates a module that contains all the directives and the given routes, but does not
 *   include the router service.
 *
 * When registered at the root, the module should be used as follows
 *
 * ```
 * @NgModule({
 *   imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(ROUTES)]
 * })
 * class MyNgModule {}
 * ```
 *
 * For submodules and lazy loaded submodules the module should be used as follows:
 *
 * ```
 * @NgModule({
 *   imports: [RouterModule.forChild(ROUTES)]
 * })
 * class MyNgModule {}
 * ```
 *
 * @description
 *
 * Adds router directives and providers.
 *
 * Managing state transitions is one of the hardest parts of building applications. This is
 * especially true on the web, where you also need to ensure that the state is reflected in the URL.
 * In addition, we often want to split applications into multiple bundles and load them on demand.
 * Doing this transparently is not trivial.
 *
 * The Angular router solves these problems. Using the router, you can declaratively specify
 * application states, manage state transitions while taking care of the URL, and load bundles on
 * demand.
 *
 * [Read this developer guide](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/router.html) to get an
 * overview of how the router should be used.

 * SyncTree is the central class for managing event callback registration, data caching, views

 * It has a number of responsibilities, including:
 *  - Tracking all user event callbacks (registered via addEventRegistration() and removeEventRegistration()).
 *  - Applying and caching data changes for user set(), transaction(), and update() calls
 *    (applyUserOverwrite(), applyUserMerge()).
 *  - Applying and caching data changes for server data changes (applyServerOverwrite(),
 *    applyServerMerge()).
 *  - Generating user-facing events for server and user changes (all of the apply* methods
 *    return the set of events that need to be raised as a result).
 *  - Maintaining the appropriate set of server listens to ensure we are always subscribed
 *    to the correct set of paths and queries to satisfy the current set of user event
 *    callbacks (listens are started/stopped using the provided listenProvider).
 *
 * NOTE: Although SyncTree tracks event callbacks and calculates events to raise, the actual
